For analyzing government spending trends and anomalies using [USASpending.gov](https://usaspending.gov) data.

A tool that lets users select a geographic region (state, county, city) and/or a spending category, then surfaces spending trends and anomalies, such as:

> "Data shows that Connecticut spending on defense increased by 34% in FY2024."

## Potential Features

* Geographic filtering (state, county, city)

* Time series analysis for detecting spending spikes
* Others?

## Data Source

USASpending.gov — data is available per fiscal year with ~42k contracts in a single state (e.g., Connecticut).

## Potential Venues
